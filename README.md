### What is Shops?
_Shops is a vanilla-style, command-driven shopping plugin for Spigot Servers._

As a shopping plugin, you can create location based stores and add/remove/update items in the inventory for your (stores).
For _customers_, when in a store, you can buy items from the store, sell items to the store, and browse the store's catalog.

### Why Command Shops?
Really this stemmed from nostalgia when I used to play on my friend's cousin's Minecraft server where it used Towny and
some location-based shopping plugin to make for an ultimate survival multiplayer server. Back then, most of your
plugins would be controlled through commands instead of UI elements.

With _newer_ features such as tab complete to autofill suggested command arguments such as online players and
materials, it really makes these command shops even easier to interact with. Sure, pulling up an inventory UI may be
much more simple and intuitive for players, I'm sure there are still server operators that enjoy a more vanilla
approach, accomplished by commands.

I intend to use this on my personal server(s) with friends/family as well. So this was really created as a personal
project that I could learn from.
